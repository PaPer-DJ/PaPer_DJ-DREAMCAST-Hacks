-----------------------------------------------

A clone of the "binhack" program made by Echelon used to hack LBA references in Sega Dreamcast Katana executables. Some features are added on top of the original ones; namely patching the bootsector to enable the VGA flag and setting the OS flag to 0 if a "bincon"-ed binary (boot.bin) is detected.

The purpose of this project is to replace the original Echelon's "binhack" utility on systems that don't support 16-bits x86 binaries (e.g. Windows 7 x64).

Features
Hack the LBA45166 reference in Dreamcast Katana binaries (45000 + 166)
Create a hacked bootsector from an original one
Drop-in replacement for original binhack
Enable all region flags in the bootsector, making it region-free
Enable the VGA flag in the bootsector, restoring VGA support for some titles
Set the OS flag to 0 in the bootsector if a binconed WinCE binary is detected
