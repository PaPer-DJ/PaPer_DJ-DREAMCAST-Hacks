IMG4DC
This package allows you to generate bootable CD images for your Sega Dreamcast. It’s split in two separate programs, usable in command-line mode:

CDI4DC : for generating Padus DiscJuggler CD images
MDS4DC : for generating Alcohol 120% CD images.
These programs have become since 2007 a ??reference in the Sega Dreamcast homebrew world, and they are used in other third-party tools such BootDreams. For these reasons I gave the source code to the community.
